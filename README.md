# UR3e
Trajectory generator, RTDE and URScript
UR3e is a robot arm from Universal Robot.
The function to realize RTDE and the original URScript in this page are from the Internet and not created by me.
Trajectory generator includes 5 algorithms, fosucing on joint space or task space. 
5 algorithms are written as 'class', which makes it convient to call in other files.
